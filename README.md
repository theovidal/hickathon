# Original subject

This subject was proposed by Hi! Paris for this edition of the Hi!ckathon:

_"The goal is to build an AI model that can **predict the watertable/ground water** levels of french piezometric stations, with a focus on the **summer** months. To build this model, you were given piezometric/watertable, weather, hydrology, water withdrawal and economic data._

_But beyond producing an AI model, the competition will ask you to **realistically project your solution in a market** / real-world context."_

# Our deliverables

We worked in a team of six in 48 hours to bring a solution for this problem, using a technical approach (Machine Learning model) as well as a business approach (a product to sell in a market).

## Machine Learning program

The notebooks in the repository are my (ThÃ©o Vidal) personal codes for the project, as the methodology in our team was to experiment various approaches for the problem and share them with the others for their own research. 

- [Hickathon.ipynb](./Hickathon.ipynb): all data cleaning, visualization, processing pipeline with model training (XGBoost with hyperparameters search)
- [Hickathon submission.ipynb](./Hickathon%20submission.ipynb): notebook for inference based on trained weights

You can also find an [HTML visualization tool](./docs/visualization.html) to preview data on a map and see the evolution in time.
